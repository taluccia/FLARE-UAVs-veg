# FLARE-UAVs-veg
## Overview

## Research Objectives

1. Determined how GCC and NDVI relate to each other across a fine (25 cm) to coarse (10 m) spatial resolution to understand how fine-scale heterogeneity influences reflectance. 
2. Evaluated how these vegetation indices correspond to aboveground carbon biomass and basal area of live trees and tall deciduous shrubs. 
3. Assessed how vegetation indices distinguish burned versus unburned areas and edge effects.
